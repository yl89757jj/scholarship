Hi All,

Please see our update below. Hope you are enjoying your holiday weekend.



Week Behind: Get Introduced

Completed

- Initial team meeting, discussed backgrounds and skill sets
- Set up and decided initial team communication methods and document storing/sharing preferences
- Met with our company adviser, Rushabh, and had our first adviser meeting with Rushabh as well as other Bloomberg contacts on Friday 9/1
- Completed initial system diagram, wedges available within the system, and wrote user stories
- Reached out to interested Cornell Tech faculty contacts to introduce ourselves and our challenge


Week Ahead: Approach the Challenge

Upcoming:

- Establish a cadence with our company adviser (presumably weekly)
- Schedule meetings with faculty contacts to get their advice and thoughts on our challenge
- Write and deliver our team contract for the semester
- Brainstorm areas in the scholarship space we feel is under-served and start to formulate a product strategy


Risks:

- Shortened week and individual commitments will lead to a difficult turnaround for tasks and tight schedules for meetings
- Proposed scope of the project being too broad since there are a few different parties involved that could be targeted by our product


Thanks,

Michael, Kad, Feston, Lu
