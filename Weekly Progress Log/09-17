Hi All,

Hope everyone had a great time during sprint! Please find below our weekly update.

Week Behind : First Sprint!
- Updated our system diagram, wedges and user stories.
- Performed the "Smile + summarize test" with other teams in our section and received some initial feedback on our narrative. The exercise made us realize that many companies/startups have tried to tackle this issue and we needed to narrow our approach even further.
- Headed into our first sprint, having an initial idea of what wedges to focus on and what our narrative was. However, as we unpacked and brainstormed as a team, we uncovered some concerns and issues with our initial narrative and went through several iterations before deciding on our currently prototype.
- Presented our narrative and prototype the wider audience and received some really good feedback on the next steps.


Week Ahead : Iterate!
- Incorporate the feedback on presentation from other teams into the next iterations, specifically, have a more defined wedge.
- Have a call with our company adviser in order to go over our sprint presentation and iterate as needed.

Risks/Challeges
- We need to properly identify a specific wedge to focus on in order to narrow down our narrative. While we are almost there, we have to make sure that the final version incorporates the feedback we received. 
- Moreover, we will need to understand how to mitigate some of the risks associated with our proposed solution.

Have a great week!
Michael, Feston, Luna & Kad!
