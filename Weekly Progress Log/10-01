Hi All,

Please find below our weekly update.

Week Behind:
- Last week we met with several stakeholders of our "HMW" including professors, admission officers and development officers. After talking to our company adviser and Leland, we realized that we needed to better understand the ecosystem in order to find the "right" wedge and not just narrow down the wedge.
- As mentioned we had a call with our company adviser and identified some holes in our solutions.
- We created a Crit Findings Log, updated our progress board and progress log (can be found here:  https://github.com/fk257/scholarship)
- We started our User Findings Log.

Week ahead:
- There is a lot of work to do for the upcoming week. As we gather our user stories and more information on the ecosystem, we need to re-work/validate our system diagram, identify the right wedge, update our narrative and present our findings to our company advisor.
- Update the User Findings Log accordingly.
- Few key questions that need to be answered:
- How are private scholarships created, administered, and paid? (on a large/small enterprise and individual level)
- How do students find, apply and evaluate scholarships? What are the different tools out there? How do they compare?
- Research how non-profits and foundation scholarships are created, administered and paid out to students.
- Research the role of universities in the scholarship space.

Risks/Challenges:
Our biggest challenge this week is ensuring that we are looking at the whole ecosystem and working with the right system diagram. We are aware that this puts us a few steps behind but we want to make sure we have the right narrative and strong user case going into Sprint 2.

Thank you and have a great week!

Luna, Feston, Michael and Kad
