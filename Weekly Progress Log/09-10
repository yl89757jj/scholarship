Hi All,

Hope you had a great weekend. Please see our weekly update below.


Week Behind : Approach the Challenge
- We have a call with our company adviser on Friday Sept 8th and established a cadence for meetings. Meetings will be held bi-weekly (unless otherwise stated) and we will be sending weekly email updates.
- Completed and submitted the team contract. Agreed to review the contract after each sprint.
- Completed two rounds of individual sketches, before agreeing on a final version.
- Discussed the system diagram, wedges and use cases with Rushabh and Sachin. Agreed to interview some students.

Week Ahead : Going into the First Sprint
- Update system diagram, wedges and user stories as discussed.
- Submit the first version of our narrative.
- Update narrative as we iterate our sketches and select a final product sketch.

Risks/Challeges
- Understanding which wedge to specifically focused on. Our discussion with Rushabh and Sachin shed some light on this but we will hopefully gather some user stories needed to properly adjust our narrative before sprint.
- First sprint of the semester; we will need to efficiently manage expectations from each team member.

Have a great week!
Michael, Feston, Luna & Kad!
