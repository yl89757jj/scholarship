Hi All,

Please find below our weekly update.

Week Behind:
- Last week, we met as a team and we came up with our first architecture diagram. The diagram is based on our narrative and we will need to update if needed, after consulting with our company adviser.
- We set our individual goals and team goals for the semesters.
- Created team and code repository on Github.
- Came up with a development process for the next coming weeks.
- Created a Progress board on trello.
- Weekly progress log can be found on Github 

Progress Board and Weekly Progress log can be found here:

Week Ahead:
- Have a call with our company adviser in order to go over our sprint presentation, architecture diagram and iterate as needed.

Risks/Challenges:
- Making sure that the scope of our project is achievable.
- Determining the right architecture components and programming languages for both back-end and front-end systems (learning curve for the whole team as we go through this process)

Thank you and have a great week!

Kad, Michael, Luna and Feston
